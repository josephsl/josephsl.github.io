<h1>Welcome to Threshold Accessibility Response Center</h1>
<p>In 2014, Microsoft announced two significant items: Windows 10 and Windows Insider Program (WIP). By the time Windows 10 Version 1507 (RTM/1024) shipped, more than five million people have signed up for a chance to test drive early builds of Windows 10.</p>
<p>As a screen reader developer and a Windows Insider, I (Joseph Lee) felt it would be a good idea to open a website dedicated to accessibility information on Windows 10, Universal Windows Platform and others. Along with information on new builds, this website will also house scripts and builds of screen readers that provide latest fixes for preview builds.</p>
<p>As of June 2016, the latest builds of Windows 10 are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fast ring: 14361.0 (Redstone 1)</li>
<li>Slow ring: 14342.1001 (Redstone 1)</li>
<li>Release preview: 10586.338 (Threshold 2)</li>
<li>Current Branch: 10586.318 (Threshold 2)</li>
<li>Current Branch for Business: 10586.318 (Threshold 2)</li>
<li>Long-Term Servicing Branch: 10240.16854 (Threshold 1)</li>
</ul>
