<h2>Meet our webmaster</h2>
<p>Born in South Korea, I am currently studying communication studies at Los Angeles City College. I have some experience with computer science courses back when I was a student at University of California, Riverside. I'm currently volunteering as a translator and code contributor to an open-source screen reader named NonVisual Desktop Access (NVDA) and am the author of various NVDA add-ons. I also served as an inaugural chair of NVDACon International, a multi-national event dedicated to discussing NVDA screen reader</p>
