<p>Welcome to Joslee's Lab, a repository of code, musings and others from a student, a programmer, a pianist and an observer of accessibility for people with visual impairment.</p>
<h2>Meet our director</h2>
<p>Born in Seoul, South Korea, I am an organizational communication PhD student and graduate part-time instructor at University of Colorado Boulder. Prior to CU Boulder, I received bachelor of arts and master of arts in communication studies from California State University, Los Angeles. In addition, I have some experience with computer science courses back when I was a student at University of California, Riverside.</p>
<p>Currently I am a PhD student at University of Colorado Boulder, researching the relationship between organizations, technology, and disability from communication perspective while teaching undergraduates. Prior to this, I volunteered as a translator and code contributor to an open-source screen reader named NonVisual Desktop Access (NVDA) and published various NVDA add-ons. I also served as an inaugural chair of NVDACon International, a multi-national event dedicated to discussing NVDA screen reader.</p>
